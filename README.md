## Introduction 🌟

QuillSense is an AI-powered handwriting analysis application that helps users understand their handwriting patterns, mood, and overall well-being. This app takes user input, including their full name, age, sleep hours, current mood, exercise history, and a sample photo of their handwriting.

Once all inputs are collected, the data is sent to the Gemini AI model through a FastAPI backend. The model then generates a detailed analysis, including handwriting insights, mood-stress correlation, personalized recommendations, future mood predictions, and a summary. The results are presented using charts and graphs for better clarity. Users also have the option to listen to the analysis instead of reading it and can easily share the full report with others.
